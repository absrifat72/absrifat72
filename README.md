Hi there, I'm Rifat! 👋

I am a passionate **Frontend Web Developer** enthusiastic about crafting accessible and user-friendly interfaces. I love turning creative designs into functional, responsive websites and am constantly improving my coding practices.

Currently, my primary focus is **JavaScript**. 
I am diving deep into the language to master DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and modern ES6+ syntax. I am currently building interactive projects to solidify my logic and problem-solving skills.

I utilize a modern stack to build my projects:
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Editor:** VS Code, Brackets
* **Design Tools:** Figma, Photoshop

I am always open to discussing new projects or opportunities!
